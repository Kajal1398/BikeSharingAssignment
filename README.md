# Project Name - Bike Sharing Assignment
>A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

## General Information
   A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. It is required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
   
### The company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands

- Provide general information about your project here.
- What is the background of your project?
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
- What is the dataset that is being used?

## Steps Performed
- Data understanding and exploration
- Data Visualisation
- Data preparation
- Model building and evaluation

## Technologies Used
- numpy - version 1.20.3
- pandas - version 1.3.4
- matplotlib - version 3.4.3
- plotly - version 5.6.0
- seaborn - version 0.11.2
- statsmodels - version 0.12.2
- sklearn - version 0.24.2
- scipy - version 1.7.1   

## Conclusions
On analysing data, it was observed that, the linear regression model was able to predict bike demand precisely with an R2 Score of more than 77%
Analysing the above model, the comapany should focus on the following features: Company should focus on expanding business during holidays. Company should focus on expanding business during Light Snow. Based on previous data it is expected to have a boom in number of users once situation comes back to normal, compared to 2019. There would be less bookings during Light Snow or Rain, they could probably use this time to serive the bikes without having business impact.
